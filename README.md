# IDAProBoschME7
Siemens Bosch ME7.x Disassembler Helper for IDA Pro

This is Andy Whittaker's code updated as follows:

Update for compile with Visual C++ 2008
Update for compiling against IDA SDK 6.8 (will not run against earlier versions)
Added functions:
	ASAP file import
	Decode interrupt Vector Table
	Added more functions definitions
	Removed Vauxhall Astra specific code

This plugin will attempt to remove a lot of manual work from a raw binary and then try and disassemble it into more meaningful code.
